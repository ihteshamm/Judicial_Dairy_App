Notable exceptions to dischargeability are taxes and student loans. A discharge releases a debtor from personal liability for certain debts known as dischargeable debts and prevents the creditors owed those debts from taking any action against the debtor or the debtor's property to collect the debts. The discharge also prohibits creditors from communicating with the debtor regarding the debt, including through telephone calls, letters, and personal contact.\",\r\n           \"published_at\": \"2018-08-06\",\r\n           \"source\": \"US Courts Glossary\"\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n           \"title\": \"Dischargeable debt\",\r\n           \"letter\": \"D\",\r\n           \"permalink\": \"usc-dischargeable-debt\",\r\n           \"body\": \"A debt for which the Bankruptcy Code allows the debtor's personal liability to be eliminated.\",\r\n           \"published_at\": \"2018-08-06\",\r\n           \"source\": \"US Courts Glossary\"\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n           \"title\": \"Disclosure statement\",\r\n           \"letter\": \"D\",\r\n           \"permalink\": \"usc-disclosure-statement\",\r\n           \"body\": \"A written document prepared by the chapter 11 debtor or other plan proponent that is designed to provide \\\"adequate information\\\" to creditors to enable them to evaluate the chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\",\r\n           \"published_at\": \"2018-08-06\",\r\n           \"source\": \"US Courts Glossary\"\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n           \"title\": \"Discovery\",\r\n           \"letter\": \"D\",\r\n           \"permalink\": \"usc-discovery\",\r\n           \"body\": \"Procedures used to obtain disclosure of evidence before trial.\",\r\n           \"published_at\": \"2018-08-06\",\r\n           \"source\": \"US Courts Glossary\"\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n           \"title\": \"Dismissal with prejudice\",\r\n           \"letter\": \"D\",\r\n           \"permalink\": \"usc-dismissal-with-prejudice\",\r\n           \"body\": \"Court action that prevents an identical lawsuit from being filed later.\",\r\n           \"published_at\": \"2018-08-06\",\r\n           \"source\": \"US Courts Glossary\"\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n           \"title\": \"Dismissal without prejudice\",\r\n           \"letter\": \"D\",\r\n           \"permalink\": \"usc-dismissal-without-prejudice\",\r\n           \"body\": \"Court action that allows the later filing.\",\r\n           \"published_at\": \"2018-08-06\",\r\n           \"source\": \"US Courts Glossary\"\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n           \"title\": \"Disposable income\",\r\n           \"letter\": \"D\",\r\n           \"permalink\": \"usc-disposable-income\",\r\n           \"body\": \"Income not reasonably necessary for the maintenance or support of the debtor or dependents.
